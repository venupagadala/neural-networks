# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task with applications in oncology and surgery. The BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset offers labeled 3D MRI scans for research. We introduced RU-Net, a modified deep learning model, for accurate segmentation while addressing data scarcity. Employing a teacher-student model and pseudo-labeling enhanced accuracy. Our RU-Net model achieved precise segmentation results with the whole tumor achieving a Dice score of 0.7234, and the necrotic, enhancing, and edema subregions achieving Dice scores of 0.7172, 0.7863, and 0.8557, respectively. Future work includes incorporating pre-trained autoencoder weights. RU-Net, based on U-Net with added RES (Residual Extended Skip) blocks, demonstrates its value for medical professionals in oncology and surgery. This project underscores the role of deep learning in medical research and the potential for improving diagnosis and treatment through machine learning.
