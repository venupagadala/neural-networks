# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

Brain tumor segmentation plays a vital role in oncology and surgical planning. Using the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset, which provides labeled 3D MRI scans, we developed RU-Net, a modified deep learning model designed to enhance segmentation accuracy while addressing data scarcity issues. Our approach incorporated a teacher-student model and pseudo-labeling techniques, which significantly improved accuracy. The RU-Net model demonstrated precise segmentation capabilities, achieving a Dice score of 0.7234 for the whole tumor and Dice scores of 0.7172, 0.7863, and 0.8557 for the necrotic, enhancing, and edema subregions, respectively. Looking ahead, we plan to integrate pre-trained autoencoder weights to further refine the model's performance. RU-Net, an extension of the U-Net architecture with additional Residual Extended Skip (RES) blocks, proves to be a valuable tool for medical professionals in the fields of oncology and surgery. This project highlights the critical role of deep learning in medical research, with promising implications for improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies through advanced machine learning techniques.
